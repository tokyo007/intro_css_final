  <h1>This is a list of popular small-cap stocks listed in the United States</h1>
  
  <h2>According to the <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/small-cap.asp">Investopedia Website</a>, mid-cap stocks are stocks with market capitalization between $250 million USD and $2 billion USD.</h2>
  <h3>Although small-cap stocks carry more risk than either large-cap or mid-cap stocks, they offer attractive returns based on expected higher than average growth rates and lower valuation multiples. Many investors have seen investments in small-cap stocks rise by 10x - 100x. However, many, many investors have also realized a 100% investment loss as small-cap companies go bankrupt and fail.  So, if you are ready to take risk and do not mind high volatility, investing in small-cap stocks might be for you.</h3>
